# Someting About Me
### Introduce
I am a student. At least during my final editing of this article. I like to develop software and toolkits using Python. I advocate open source, but I don't want my name to be forgotten, so I usually choose the Apache-2.0 open source license.

### Experience of Learning Programming
I really enjoy hardware programming and software programming. I started playing LEGO WEDO at the age of 8 and started playing MINDSTORMS EV3 a year later. I really like this LEGO suite, but when I heard it was discontinued, I felt a little disappointed. In the fourth grade of elementary school. I started learning Python 3 and it took me two years to get started and put it into practice. Just six months after I started learning Python 3, I gradually fell in love with Python 3 and computers, and enjoyed writing programs for them. Later, I learned about Github, open source, and its vast community. I have learned a lot of programming knowledge online, which has provided me with assistance when dealing with complex problems. In sixth grade, I started learning C++. But because many of its keywords are very similar and the syntax is completely different from Python 3, it makes it difficult for me to accept. So I usually use Python 3 for programming.
